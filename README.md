Do you have some maps you want to place objects on?
Do you want to locate a colleague, a building, a room, or some other objects?
KISSLocator keeps it simple for you. The setup takes about a minute, so give it a try!

KISSLocator provides you url links to the locations on your maps in the following format.
<domain>/KISSLocator.html?area=<map name>&x=<x coordinate on the map>&y=<y coordinate on the map>#map<floor id>

The url links can be used in mail subscriptions, or added to shared personal properties.
It is easy and practical to source into a wiki, but it can be also used on shares, without http.

# Install
(1) Upload your map images (svg, png, jpg, etc.), along with the KISSLocator.html, the KISSLocator_config.js, and the topleft_arrow_transparent_bg.png to the same intranet, shared, or wiki location
(2) Update the KISSLocator_config.js file so that it stores references to your uploaded maps
(3) Enjoy!
